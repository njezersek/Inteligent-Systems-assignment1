## Libraries
```{r}
library(GA)
```

## Population

```{r}
f <- function(x) 
{
  y <- (0.46 * (dnorm(x, -1, 2/3) + dnorm(x, 1, 2/3)) +
          (1/300) * (dnorm(x, -0.5, 0.01) + dnorm(x, -1, 0.01) +
                       dnorm(x, -1.5, 0.01)) +
          (7/300) * (dnorm(x, 0.5, 0.07) + dnorm(x, 1, 0.07) +
                       dnorm(x, 1.5, 0.07)))
  
  y ### return(y)
}
curve(f, from = -3, to = 3, n = 1000)

```
```{r}
GA <- ga(type = "real-valued", fitness = f, lower = -3, upper = 3)
plot(GA)
```
```{r}
summary(GA)
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
